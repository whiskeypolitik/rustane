# Compile/IOSurface Regression Note

- Timestamp: `2026-03-25 15:00`
- Branch: `codex/latency-parallel-research`
- HEAD commit: `9e36f9a5bbb2d4304fbb914a1ea23b933f439550`
- Local `ane` dependency: path dependency to `/Users/andrewgordon/other-projects/ane/crates/ane`
- Local `ane` branch/rev: `compile-fixed` @ `900a70607eac249b1cfbf622439ab1db2589164f`
- Phase: forward benchmark rollout verification

## Last successful gate

- `cargo test -p engine --release -- --list`
- Result: passed on the current worktree with the local `ane` path dependency

## Failing command

```bash
make forward-7b
```

## Requested/applied shard counts

- Requested `ATTN_SHARDS`: omitted
- Requested `FFN_SHARDS`: omitted
- Applied mode: baseline

## Failing shape

- Benchmark: `7B`
- Shape: `dim=4096 hidden=11008 heads=32 nlayers=32 seq=512`
- Printed estimate: `26.8GB`

## Notes

- This is an IOSurface allocation/runtime failure, not an ANE compile failure.
- The failure happened on the baseline `make forward-7b` path before any sharded forward mode was exercised.
- Because the local `ane` path dependency was changed in the same worktree, that dependency change is a primary suspect and should be isolated before continuing the forward benchmark rollout.
